# Summary of the project.

* I started with wrangling the data by reviewing it, cleaning it, looking at the variables of interest, adding some columns, deleting unnecessary variables and getting it ready for analysis.
* I used Matplotlib and Seaborn to research and explore the data for one variable at a time, then multivariate, to look for relationships.
* I summarized the findings that I discovered.
* Last stage - I created a Google slide to explain the main findings using plots, a written explanation, and my recommendations.
