# Summery of the project.

* I started with wrangling the data by reviewing it, cleaning it, looking of the interesting variables, adding some columns and       deleting unnecessary variables and getting it ready for analysis.
* I used Matplotlib and Seaborn to research and explore the data from one variable at a time to multivariate to look for             relationship.
* I summarized the findings that i found.
* Last stage i created a Google slide to explain the main findings using plots and a written explanation and my recommendations.
